# Weather_Quest
Sample Android App



I made this app as a simple demonstration to show what I can do as an Android developer. 
It uses Jetpack Compose and libraries such as Hilt, Room, Retrofit, and Moshi. 
Users can get weather data based on their deviceâ€™s location or search for a location using the search bar. 
The search bar gives suggestions for locations as the user types. 
Once a location is chosen, the app fetches the weather data from a server and displays the current weather and forecast for the selected location. 
The UI features some animations, and the background image changes based on the current weather. 
Please give my app a look to see what I can do.
 It can also be downloaded from the Google Play Store at the following address:
